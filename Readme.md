# RL Project 1 - Team 14

## Project: Windy Gridworld

This project is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) solution for the Windy Gridworld problem.

## Project Structure

### Algorithm Implementations

[`PI.ipynb`](./PI.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for Policy Iteration method.

[`VI.ipynb`](./VI.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for Value Iteration method.

[`MC.ipynb`](./MC.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for Monte Carlo method.

[`TD.ipynb`](./TD.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for Temporal Difference method.

[`QL.ipynb`](./QL.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for Q-Learning method.

### Environemnt and Agent

[`agent.py`](./agent.py): Contains the Agent class which interacts with the environment and learns from it.

[`model.py`](./model.py): Contains the Model class which represents the environment.

[`policy.py`](./policy.py): Contains the Policy class which dictates the agent's actions.

[`system.py`](./system.py): Contains system-level configurations and utilities.

## How to Run

Each of the Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) can be run individually to see the results of the respective RL methods.
